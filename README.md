This is an other fork of jbullet, the fork includes :

* [jbullet 20101010-1](http://jbullet.advel.cz/) a port of bullet 2.72 (a physics engine) minus some features
* the Spring Constraint (Generic6DofSpringConstraint) from https://github.com/affogato/JBullet-QIntBio-Fork
* the modification from jmonkeyengine team (see commits)
* a relayout of the project to build with gradle, demo (code + dependencies) moves under test
